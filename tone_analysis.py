# ==========================
# ðŸŒ· NEXT STEP:
# ==========================
# In your bot.py, when you call the tone analysis:
# 1. Analyze the userâ€™s message
# 2. Ask for confirmation ("I sense you're feeling X, am I right?")
# 3. If confirmed, send the supportive reply.
#
# This allows a more human-like, empathetic conversation flow.
